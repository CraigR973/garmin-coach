 * The single "what needs Mark next" action for Home (Batch 50 — action-first).
 *
 * Since Batch 45 the app is push-first: the morning verdict and every
 * post-workout read push the moment they land, so Mark arrives on Home to *act*.
 * This resolver turns the daily-loop payload into the one context-aware primary
 * action — driving both the "Next" strip under the verdict hero and (via
 * {@link actionSection}) which section is expanded, overriding the Batch 37/48
 * phase→primary selection so a pending item is never stranded in a collapsed
 * off-phase section.
 *
 * It is deliberately **payload-only and pure** (no clock read of its own — the
 * caller threads a single `isEvening`), so the whole priority ladder is
 * unit-testable. `sectionKey` marks an action that lives in a Home section (the
 * expansion override target); `to` marks one that navigates away.
